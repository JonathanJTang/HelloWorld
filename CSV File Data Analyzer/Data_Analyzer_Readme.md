# CSV File Data Analyzer

Written in Python 3.5.2

Based on data (obtained from surveys) in a .csv file according to the format described below, the program analyzes the data for potential patterns and display patterns of interest on the screen with Python's `turtle` module.

Currently calculates answer frequency; measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode, Q1, Q3, interquartile range (IQR); and linear correlation: the correlation coefficient.

Still in progress
